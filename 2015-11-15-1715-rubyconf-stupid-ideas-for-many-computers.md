# Stupid Ideas For Many Computers By Aja Hammerly

## Pre
Sitting on the fail bus, and decided to do another version of the "Worst. Ideas. Ever." talk that Aaron Pattersin and Ryan Davis.

## Load Testing
Really Stupid Load Testing

Ran mechanize and viewed rails logs.

Load testing - Make a whole bunch of computers test the same thing on the same machine

This talk was fun and wacky. Not a lot of notes for it.

Moral of the talk: Don't be afraid to act stupid and have fun
