  - Known knowns
  - Known Unknowns
  - Unknown Unknowns
  - Unknown knowns (Ideology)

Ideology (in order of increasing difficulty to deal with)
  - Philosophy
    - Epistemology - theory of knowledge
      - I _know_ about GC
    - Metaphysics
      - Correctness is categorical
    - Ethics
      - I'm not a real programmer (imposter syndrome) (therefore I'm bad)
  - Rhetoric - the act of convincing people of things

Example Thread "on the internet" (2002)
- "Convince me we should do garbage collection"
- "GC is Impractical" - Gary
  - No better GC algos exists (except the one he's been exposed)
    - This is an ideological belief and it was wrong.

## Types & Tests
- Argument for tests
  - Ruby needs tests because there's no type checker
  - There are dependently typed languages but they are esoteric
- Argument against tests
  - I write tests anyways so I don't need a type checker
  - Tests are exmaples of behavior

  - Types
    - Languages in the ML family


"I'm bad at math"
 - Traditional advice: "Stop saying you're bad at math"
 - This doesn't work.
Computer science is based on formal mathematics
