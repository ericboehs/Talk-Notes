# Consequences Of An Insightful Algorithm by Carina C. Zona

Algorithm bingo
  - Target tracks pregnancy without mother's knowing
    - Now they hide their adds within other products
  - Shutterfly does something similar reminding mothers of miscarriages —
     "Congrats on the new baby"
  - Facebook has a year in review… for dead children
  - Fitbit initially tracked sex activity – publicly
  - Uber had a God View mode that identified users and celebrities exposing it
    to anyone including Drivers and  applicants
  - Google Adwords allowed advertisers to target black names with "Arrested"
    where as with white names, they did not.
  - Google Photos object detect black men as apes and gorillas
     - Kodak, in the 50s, optimized exposure and color for white women – "The
       Shirley Card"

We need to commit to data transparency. Commit to algorithmic transparency.

Too many companies think that proprietary is the only way to go.

Professionals apply expertise and judgment about how to solve problems

Refuse to play along
