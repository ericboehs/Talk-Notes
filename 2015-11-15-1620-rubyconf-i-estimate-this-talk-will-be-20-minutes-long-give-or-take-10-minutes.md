# I Estimate This Talk Will Be 20 Minutes Long, Give Or Take 10 Minutes by Noel Rappin

## Pre
- How far do you live from an airport?
  - He lives 20 minutes from an airport
  - He considres that basically factual
  - Not really true though. It's based on a series of assumptions. (e.g. in a car, good weather, not rush hour, etc)
  - There's no way it could take less than 20 minutes though. And there are all kinds of ways for it to take longer.
  - He doesn't even know how far he lives from the airport in miles, only minutes.

Noel is idiosyncratic crank about estimates. If you have different ways to estimate, that's fine.

## Are software Developers uniquely bad at estimates?
Well, home remodeling is pretty bad.

Estimation is not just our problem. There are other industries that have the same issues.

Software is unique though, as our product isn't concrete, real world things (e.g. walls, raods, bridges).

Some say project estimates are so bad that they are a net negative to project management. Just do stuff and get paid. Take the highest priority task and work it. Until things are done or your out of money or your client gets mad.

This doesn't seem effective to Noel. It's like saying, we're going to tear up your Kitchen, and just keep giving us $15k checks and you'll hopefully eventually get a working kitchen.o

## _Estimates are communication_ but communication with $$ attached.

You're communicating (things that need to be done for a good estimate):
  - an investment
  - progress
  - scope

Bad estimates communicate:
  - Unrealistic expectations
  - Way too much

Just do good estimate. How?

Estimating at the beginning is the _worst_. But clients and PMs want to know at the beginning.

## What can make a project estimate effective at the beginning?

Terms:
  - Feature/Story: a unit of work in a project (independent of each other)
  - Iteration: the unit of planning in a project
  - Point: the size of a story
  - Velocity: the number of points you can do in an iteration (most important number)

### Theory of a good estimate
  - Estimating projects vs estimating features
  - Nobody cares about the fine grained feature estimates
  - They only care about when customer can use stuff

Estimates are estimates! If they were exact we'd call them measurements.

Estimates are problematic. For example, if a weather forecaster estimates it will rain and it doesn't. People aren't as mad as if he estimated it  won't rain and it does.

Bad Assumptions
Scope Creep
Unknown Complexity
Rework (coming to a shared understanding of what done looks like)

Developers are [too] optimistic.

There's also pressure. "This has to be done by Monday. When can it be done by?"

~ Broke from taking notes

We sure be measuring our time doing things.

The skill of the developer.

Teams development out is roughly equal from week to week.

We are pretty good at estimating complexity.

Estimate complexity and let time sort itself out.
  - This gets us the classic _point_.

Decomposing the problem into similar sized chunks helps
One-off estimates are problematic.


## How to estimate at the beginning
- Fake your velocity (since you can't know it ahead of time)
- Don't spend time chasing precision
- Your output is a range (low to high)
- Split the tasks as best you can and assign points to them
- Round up if there is a discrepancy between points
- At the beginning (and only at the beginning) you can range estimate stories
- You end up with a range of points (add them up) e.g. (100-120)
- Apply a load factor. (each point is 5-7 hours or we can work 10-20 points in a week)
  - Again, if you assign a time factor to points you are over simplifying it. But you have to without knowing your velocity
- Multiple out rate * hours to get a range ($75k - $126k)

## Questions
Q: Agile doesn't have a master plan
A: Master story plan is the real world solution

Q: What if there is a long story that isn't complex (simple to do; just takes a long time)?
A: Least bad answer he has: maybe break it into several small stories or just let it be an outlier

Q: When making an estimate, do you take in to account the framework you're developing it in (e.g. ember, node, rails)?
A: No, the framework will impact the velocity. If you're struggling with the framework your velocity will go down. Let the stories be the stories.
